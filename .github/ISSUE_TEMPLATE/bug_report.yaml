**GUIDELINES FOR REPORTING BUGS**

If you are new to SQLAlchemy bug reports, please review our many examples
of [well written bug reports](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22great+mcve%22).   Each of these reports include the following features:

1. a **succinct description of the problem** - typically a line or two at most

2. **succinct, dependency-free code which reproduces the problem**, otherwise known as a [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) example.

3. **complete stack traces for all errors - please avoid screenshots, use formatted text inside issues**

4. Other things as applicable:   **SQL log output**, **database backend and DBAPI driver**,
   **operating system**, **comparative performance timings** for performance issues.
